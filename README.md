# Calculator-java

Welcome to the Calculator I created, a simple Java application that allows you to perform basic math operations. This project was developed as part of my programming learning.

## Functionalities

This Calculator offers the following operations:

1. **Add:** Adds two numbers.
2. **Subtract:** Subtracts the second number from the first.
3. **Multiply:** Multiplies two numbers.
4. **Divide:** Divide the first number by the second.

## How to use

1. When starting the program, you will be greeted with a welcome message.
2. Enter the first and second number when prompted.
3. Choose the desired operation by typing the corresponding number.
4. The result of the selected operation will be displayed.

If an invalid number is entered or an unrecognized operation is chosen, the program will provide an informational message.

Feel free to explore, contribute or provide suggestions to improve this simple calculator. I am continually learning and improving my systems development skills.

## How to Execute

To run the code, you will need a Java environment configured on your machine. Simply compile and run the `Main.java` file to start using the Calculator.

Have fun calculating!
